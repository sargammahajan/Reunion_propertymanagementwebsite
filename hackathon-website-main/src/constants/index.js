This name perfectly suits the insects in this group because their wings are covered with thousands of tiny scales overlapping in rows.\nAn agency of the Governmental Wildlife Conservation is planning to implement an automated system based on computer vision so that it can identify butterflies based on captured images. As a consultant for this project, you are responsible for developing an efficient model.\nYour Task is to build an Image Classification Model using CNN that classifies to which class of weather each image belongs to.",

        desc: "Many industries have the need to identify current and past weather conditions. The data helps them plan, organize, and/or optimize their operations. For example, farmers might look at the current weather to decide if the sprinklers should be turned on or off. Ski resort operators might choose to enable snowmaking machines based on varying weather conditions across the mountain. Construction workers might plan out the supplies and rain gear they\â€™ll need for a remote job site.\nCurrently, making such decisions can require manually looking at video feeds from remote cameras, relying on weather forecasts, or simply looking out the window.\nUsing machine learning (ML) offers the potential to automate this by providing a digital eye. More specifically, if an image recognition ML model could be built to identify conditions by simply looking at images of the weather, it could be deployed in scenarios like those described above. For example, a camera feed on a farm could be processed by an ML model deployed on an IoT device at the edge (e.g., on a smart camera). That model can then be used to automatically determine the current weather conditions and enable or disable sprinkler valves accordingly.\nTo demonstrate this use case, your task will be to build a model in PerceptiLabs trained to classify four different types of weather: cloudy, shine, sunrise, and rain.",

The main objective of the ICARUS Datathon is to expose the platform functionalities and features to external users, allowing them to explore and create new innovative methods of solving problems in the aviation industry based on the ICARUS platform. The participants will have the opportunity to access aviation data, identify potential aviation-related problems they can solve, and create solutions with the use of the ICARUS platform.",

During the last decades, important improvements in computer performance, advances in the field of machine learning and a boost of access to data-driven information has led to an increased interest in adopting alternative risk modeling. Predictive analytic, defined as a set of statistical learning techniques for predicting trends and outcomes, is now known as a promising path for insurance R&D, including for marketing, underwriting, fraud detection, pricing and reserve valuation. Property & Casualty (P&C) insurers were leaders in the early use of predictive analytic models given the large amount of claims for some lines of business like auto insurance, and additional insights gained from new technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT).
